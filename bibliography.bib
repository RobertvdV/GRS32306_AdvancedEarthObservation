abstract = {Civil engineering uses digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos as basic material to be able to design and execute any project. UAV photogrammetry has made it possible to obtain this type of information in an economic and practical way. However, it is necessary to know the accuracy of the data and that it is within the admissible limits. There are many factors that affect the accuracy of products resulting from UAV photogrammetry. Of all of these, the effect of the number of ground control points (GCPs) and their distribution in the study area are especially significant. Different distributions of GCPs have been studied to try to optimize the products obtained by UAV photogrammetry. Of all the distributions tested, the best results were obtained with edge distribution and stratified distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to place GCPs around the edge of the study area to minimize planimetry errors. In addition, it is advisable to create a stratified distribution inside the study area with a density of around 0.5–1 GCP × ha−1 to minimize altimetry errors. The combination of these two distributions minimizes the total error obtained.}

ABSTRACT = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors and platforms nowadays are being used in almost every application (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) that needs observed information from the top or oblique views. While they intend to be a general remote sensing (RS) tool, the relevant RS data processing and analysis methods are still largely ad-hoc to applications. Although the obvious advantages of UAV data are their high spatial resolution and flexibility in acquisition and sensor integration, there is in general a lack of systematic analysis on how these characteristics alter solutions for typical RS tasks such as land-cover classification, change detection, and thematic mapping. For instance, the ultra-high-resolution data (less than 10 cm of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)) bring more unwanted classes of objects (e.g., pedestrian and cars) in land-cover classification; the often available 3D data generated from photogrammetric images call for more advanced techniques for geometric and spectral analysis. In this paper, we perform a critical review on RS tasks that involve UAV data and their derived products as their main sources including raw perspective images, digital surface models, and orthophotos. In particular, we focus on solutions that address the &ldquo;new&rdquo; aspects of the UAV data including (1) ultra-high resolution; (2) availability of coherent geometric and spectral data; and (3) capability of simultaneously using multi-sensor data for fusion. Based on these solutions, we provide a brief summary of existing examples of UAV-based RS in agricultural, environmental, urban, and hazards assessment applications, etc., and by discussing their practical potentials, we share our views in their future research directions and draw conclusive remarks.},

abstract = {Digital Surface Models and orthoimages at high spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy is of increasing importance for many applications. From several years ago photogrammetry-UAV is being used to produce these topographic products. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of the number of Ground Control Points used for georeferencing on Digital Surface Model and orthoimage accuracies obtained with UAV-photogrammetry. In this purpose, 160 images were taken on a 17.64ha surface at 120m altitude above ground level, and five replications of photogrammetric projects taking into account 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 20 GCPs were made. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as accuracy measurement. Optimal results for RMSEX, RMSEY and RMSEXY mean±standard deviation values were reached for 15 GCPs: 3.3±0.346, 3.2±0.441, 4.6±0.340 and 4.5±0.169cm respectively. Similar conclusions was derived for vertical accuracy: lower RMSEZ mean±standard deviation values were reached for 15 and 20 GCPs: 5.8±1.21cm and 4.7±0.860cm respectively. In view of these results maps at 1:150 scale and contour interval of 15cm can be obtained from UAV-photogrammetry.}
