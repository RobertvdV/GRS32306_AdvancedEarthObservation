abstract = {Civil engineering uses digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos as basic material to be able to design and execute any project. UAV photogrammetry has made it possible to obtain this type of information in an economic and practical way. However, it is necessary to know the accuracy of the data and that it is within the admissible limits. There are many factors that affect the accuracy of products resulting from UAV photogrammetry. Of all of these, the effect of the number of ground control points (GCPs) and their distribution in the study area are especially significant. Different distributions of GCPs have been studied to try to optimize the products obtained by UAV photogrammetry. Of all the distributions tested, the best results were obtained with edge distribution and stratified distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to place GCPs around the edge of the study area to minimize planimetry errors. In addition, it is advisable to create a stratified distribution inside the study area with a density of around 0.5–1 GCP × ha−1 to minimize altimetry errors. The combination of these two distributions minimizes the total error obtained.}

ABSTRACT = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors and platforms nowadays are being used in almost every application (e.g., agriculture, forestry, and mining) that needs observed information from the top or oblique views. While they intend to be a general remote sensing (RS) tool, the relevant RS data processing and analysis methods are still largely ad-hoc to applications. Although the obvious advantages of UAV data are their high spatial resolution and flexibility in acquisition and sensor integration, there is in general a lack of systematic analysis on how these characteristics alter solutions for typical RS tasks such as land-cover classification, change detection, and thematic mapping. For instance, the ultra-high-resolution data (less than 10 cm of Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)) bring more unwanted classes of objects (e.g., pedestrian and cars) in land-cover classification; the often available 3D data generated from photogrammetric images call for more advanced techniques for geometric and spectral analysis. In this paper, we perform a critical review on RS tasks that involve UAV data and their derived products as their main sources including raw perspective images, digital surface models, and orthophotos. In particular, we focus on solutions that address the &ldquo;new&rdquo; aspects of the UAV data including (1) ultra-high resolution; (2) availability of coherent geometric and spectral data; and (3) capability of simultaneously using multi-sensor data for fusion. Based on these solutions, we provide a brief summary of existing examples of UAV-based RS in agricultural, environmental, urban, and hazards assessment applications, etc., and by discussing their practical potentials, we share our views in their future research directions and draw conclusive remarks.},

abstract = {Digital Surface Models and orthoimages at high spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy is of increasing importance for many applications. From several years ago photogrammetry-UAV is being used to produce these topographic products. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of the number of Ground Control Points used for georeferencing on Digital Surface Model and orthoimage accuracies obtained with UAV-photogrammetry. In this purpose, 160 images were taken on a 17.64ha surface at 120m altitude above ground level, and five replications of photogrammetric projects taking into account 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 20 GCPs were made. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as accuracy measurement. Optimal results for RMSEX, RMSEY and RMSEXY mean±standard deviation values were reached for 15 GCPs: 3.3±0.346, 3.2±0.441, 4.6±0.340 and 4.5±0.169cm respectively. Similar conclusions was derived for vertical accuracy: lower RMSEZ mean±standard deviation values were reached for 15 and 20 GCPs: 5.8±1.21cm and 4.7±0.860cm respectively. In view of these results maps at 1:150 scale and contour interval of 15cm can be obtained from UAV-photogrammetry.}

ABSTRACT = {Sensor miniaturisation, improved battery technology and the availability of low-cost yet advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have provided new opportunities for environmental remote sensing. The UAV provides a platform for close-range aerial photography. Detailed imagery captured from micro-UAV can produce dense point clouds using multi-view stereopsis (MVS) techniques combining photogrammetry and computer vision. This study applies MVS techniques to imagery acquired from a multi-rotor micro-UAV of a natural coastal site in southeastern Tasmania, Australia. A very dense point cloud ( < 1–3 cm point spacing) is produced in an arbitrary coordinate system using full resolution imagery, whereas other studies usually downsample the original imagery. The point cloud is sparse in areas of complex vegetation and where surfaces have a homogeneous texture. Ground control points collected with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) are identified and used for georeferencing via a Helmert transformation. This study compared georeferenced point clouds to a Total Station survey in order to assess and quantify their geometric accuracy. The results indicate that a georeferenced point cloud accurate to 25–40 mm can be obtained from imagery acquired from ~50 m. UAV-based image capture provides the spatial and temporal resolution required to map and monitor natural landscapes. This paper assesses the accuracy of the generated point clouds based on field survey points. Based on our key findings we conclude that sub-decimetre terrain change (in this case coastal erosion) can be monitored.},

abstract = {For the geodetic survey of the terrain surface, the use of conventional surveying methods and instruments is common. New technologies, such as e.g. UAVs and their combination with a digital camera, bring new opportunities also in the documentation of Earth’s surface. This combination of technologies allows for the use of low-cost digital photogrammetry to document the Earth’s surface in relation to mining activities. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to analyze the accuracy of the digital elevation model (DEM) obtained using low-cost UAV photogrammetry. The surface mine Jastrabá (Slovakia) was chosen as the test area. The mine has morphologically dissected surface and is thus suitable for verifying the use of UAV photogrammetry to capture fairly intricate details on the surface. The research, which has been carried out, showed that the model created from photogrammetric data from the UAV achieves the accuracy required by current national legislation. From the selection of the test consisting of 237 points, only 3 points failed the conditions for the accuracy of the detailed points. These results indicate that the combination of low-cost UAV and a digital camera may be used as a viable alternative for the collection of data with the goal to document surface structures and to form 3D models formed from this data. The use of UAV in a photogrammetric survey of the mine brings new opportunities for the creation of documentation, because with this technology we can measure the entire surface in detail, create orthophoto maps of the entire area and document inaccessible parts of the area such as sludge dumps, and steep slopes.}
